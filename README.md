# Software Engineering for Scientists (SE4Sci) Hack-a-thon 4 Project

## Overview

The aim of this project is to create a retrieval augmented generation (RAG) engine. Retrieval augmented generation retrieves relevant information in a full natural language based on the input, and uses it as a prompt for a large language model to generate a suitable response. This project is completed primarily in Python.


## Contents

The project contains the following:

```text
.gitignore          - this will ignore vagrant and other metadata files
requirements.txt    - list if Python libraries required by your code
src                 - contains watson discovery and prompt files
.env                - contains watson discovery connection details
templates           - contains front end template files for Flask API
README              - the current file
app.py              - contains front end configuration using Fast API
index.html          - contains HTML formatting for homepage
qa.csv              - contains some model q&a examples
rag_results_flanuls_llama.csv - contains some model q&a examples
```



## Discovery and LLM Performance Evaluation Code

### query_watson_discovery_and_llm_v2.py
```
Code to access the Watson Discovery H4 Instance for context, run multiple models plot and 
log model performance on 20 question set
``` 

#### Inputs:
    qa.csv  (file must reside in same folder as this notebook)
    .env file with credentials
    
#### Outputs:
    printed list of question, correct response and predicted response for multiple llm models
    plots of model performance and logged statistics based on Bleu score
    plots are saved to the local directory as image files
    
#### Datasets
    qa.csv  20 question/answer pairs
    
    .env    credentials file
#### Code sources and acknowledgements

### plot_model_perf.py
Code to plot model performance statistics
#### Inputs:
    model performance file generated by program  query_watson_discovery_and_llm_v2.py
    model_perf.csv  (file must reside in same folder as this notebook)
    
#### Outputs:
    plot of multi model performance
    
#### Datasets
    model_perf.csv  model performance results file (generated from query_watson_discovery_and_llm_v2.py)
